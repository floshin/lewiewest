The man, the myth, the legend - Lewie West! (@lewie.west) on the Passive Hang. Lewie is a generalist acrobat who has been performing around the world for the past 12 years, now settled in Tasmania, Australia.

We learn his approach to acrobatic movement - creating options, utilising the whole body (not just feet and hands!), floor surfaces, falling, mental preparation, creative inspiration and sequencing, skill acquisition.

Yep, it's a great conversation.

Lewie is now stepping into a new phase in his life - becoming a father, and teaching. Very excited to see this develop. Thanks Lewie for sharing your insights and time.
