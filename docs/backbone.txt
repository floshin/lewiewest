LEWIE WEST (acrobat) is an Australian
acrobat through and through. He probably
has circus in his blood stream due to all
the rosin, chalk, and acrobat sweat he’s
accidentally ingested over the years. He
started in Warehouse Youth Circus in
Canberra before training at The National
Institute of Circus Arts. After earning
his bachelor’s degree, West performed,
created, and choreographed with Circa for seven years, finding
time to sneak off and earn a gold medal in Paris at the Festival
Mondial du Cirque de Demain, or what his Mum calls “the
circus Olympics” for his solo aerial straps act. In spite of this,
West still considers himself to be mostly an ensemble acrobat
and is very happy to come into “work” every day to create, move,
and play with the group.
