      <h2>Coaching</h2>

      <p><em>Florian: I just make suggestions of what I imagine here. My idea is that you should have no work at all with this website, nothing really to maintain, so that this page can remain almost unchanged for months or years, just adding a new video or a new gallery every now and then. Thus, you could for instance write something like this:</em></p>

      <p>In 20XX, because of Y, I started to concentrate more on coaching, ... Since then I have a number of students all over the world and enjoy teaching them what I've learned, ... But since I'm also working as a coach in Z and otherwise touring
      with GOM(?), I have to limit the number of students I teach, ...</p>

      <p>If you'd like to learn from me: I am sharing if I currently have capacity for additional students In my Instagram status. See <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lewie.west/">@lewie.west</a>
      </p>

      <p>As a student you get access to a private library where you find exclusive videos 
        of me explaining different concepts, showing some tricks and progressions 
        and give all kinds of advise for your training. The library is like a foundation
        on which you can build your own individual floor acro, with some help by me. :)</p>
      
      <p>The training is organised on Signal or WhatsApp.</p>


      <h3>Testimonials</h3>

      <p><em>Here you could add short texts from some students of yours and perhaps also some pictures and links to students in case that you think that they have reached specific milestones/mastery of stuff? Example:</em></p>

      <p><strong>Florian</strong>: Lewie inspired me to start acrobatics as an adult. Throughout my childhood and youth I was just skateboarding, mainly inspired by freestyle and in particular by Rodney Mullen. I stumbled upon Lewies works on YouTube in about 2009 and was totally flashed. And I came to like him even more when I heard him saying in an interview that he approached acrobatics inspired by skateboarding.<br>
      A few years later after some personal crisis, finally motivated enough to dive into this journey, I joined an acrobatic gymnastics club. At first I just wanted to learn handstands and tumbling, but soon I found my passion in mixed pair hand to hand. I followed Lewies work sporadically throughout the years and in 2020, shortly after another great crisis in my life, I heard Lewie mentioning in a podcast that he started coaching.<br> 
      I didn't hesitate a second and got the opportunity to learn from the master himself - Lewie is like the Rodney Mullen of freestyle acrobatics.<!--<br> 
      Just like him he and his videos had an impact on the art as a whole; and just as Rodney with his concept of "stancelessness", being equally good at skating on both sides, Lewie learns and teaches his tricks on both sides; there is no real mastery achieved if the ability is limited to only one side of your body, not to speak of the implications for muscular balance and health, greatly neglected in sports acro.--></p>
