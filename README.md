## TODO @ Lewie

* Give your blessing to my latest (probably final) update to the pages.
* Registration of a domain like lewiewest.com.au, preferably at [INWX.de](https://www.inwx.de/en)
* Gallery:  
  (1) Do you want to write a little text to every gallery? Like:   
      Fold was a project, where it was about..., my role was... etc.  
  (2) Can you order the photos on google drive a little according to act etc.?   
      Maybe like: Act X (date: year(s) Y with company Z). Or if its a specific  
      show or festival, then a folder for: "Cirque du Demain 20XY" or if its  
      training, then stuff like: Training Straps, Training Pole, Training 2019 or so  
      Then I can make galleries out of all those stuff. Otherwise its too confusing.  
* Additional testimonials + little acro photo from some students (hasn't to be online students)
* Log into YouTube and enable playback on external pages for "Mucking Around I".
* Maybe you have a list of interviews/links/podcasts and stuff to add to the press page?
* Is there a backup of all the youtube videos?  
  If so, I would like to do an additional online backup just in case:  
  When a video is deleted by YouTube, we'll still have a copy.  


## TODO @ Florian

* External backup of all YouTube videos
* One additional subpage could be "Press" with a collection   
  of the podcasts and interviews and links to them.
* Make a royalty free acrolib logo with a book and add as third icon?
