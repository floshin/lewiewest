# lewiewest-test

## TODO @ Lewie

* Text about you for the 'About' page
* Review/Rewriting of the text for the 'Coaching' page
* Providing an email you want to display in public (or instagram only?)
* Registration of a domain like lewiewest.com.au, preferably at [INWX.de](https://www.inwx.de/en)
* Providing permission to use photos by Darcy/Carnival Cinema etc. 
* Telling me which photos should be in the Gallery and sending me photos  
  if there should be anything that I do not have and that you would like to be there  
  * I then add and order them, maybe like: Act XY (date: year(s)))
* Log into YouTube and enable playback on external pages for Mucking Around I.
* Is there a backup of all the youtube videos?  
  If so, I would like to do an additional online backup just in case:  
  When a video is deleted by YouTube, we'll still have a copy.  


## TODO @ Florian

* External backup of all YouTube videos
* One additional subpage could be "Press" with a collection   
  of the podcasts and interviews and links to them.
* Contact information for the website (Matrix ID or personal page)
* Adding photo for the testimonials?
